# **App Name**: DoughVerse Landing

## Core Features:

- Landing Page Sections: Implement a landing page with sections for Header, Hero Image, Tokenomics, Roadmap, About Us, Join Community, and Footer, styled with Claymorphism.
- Claymorphic UI Elements: Claymorphic design applied to all elements including cards, buttons, and sections. Appropriate box-shadow and hover effects, specified by the user, should be incorporated into interactive elements like cards and buttons to enhance the tactile feel of playdough.
- Interactive Hero Section: Incorporate a Hero Image section featuring the provided image with the heading "$DOH" in a colorful animated gradient loop, tagline "to the traders," a claymorphism-styled timer card, animated clay-textured shapes, and a pastel color animated loop gradient in the background.
- Tokenomics Visualization: Implement a visual representation of Tokenomics using claymorphed cards with charts, graphs, and infographics for Token supply, allocations, a pie chart, the contract address (L1X), token utilities, a how-to-buy tutorial with wallet and DEX links, and a live price chart embedded from DexScreener.
- Roadmap Infographics: Design creative and 3D claymorphed infographics to visually represent the roadmap, including phases like Token launch, NFT collection, DoughGames Terminal, and integration of fight scenes, a merch store, and a mobile app.
- Scrolling Marquee: Include a Marquee section that displays scrolling text with "$DOH to the traders."

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light pastel orange (#FFB347) to reflect the playful, dough-like nature of the theme, providing a warm, inviting feel.
- Background color: Very light beige (#F5F5DC), emulating the base color of playdough while keeping the page bright and cheerful. The beige will have approximately 15% saturation.
- Accent color: Soft sky blue (#87CEEB) analogous to orange to provide contrast and highlight interactive elements. This adds a refreshing visual element.
- Font Pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines to provide a modern, rounded aesthetic and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability. Both align with the playful theme without sacrificing clarity.
- Icons: Use rounded, playful icons with a slight 3D effect, in colors that complement the primary palette. This reinforces the theme and maintains a consistent design language across the interface.
- Apply the Claymorphism style aspects by creating shadowed elements throughout.
- Subtle animations that mimic the malleable quality of clay; hover effects and transitions add an interactive and engaging layer to the overall design. Use of smooth transitions will help enhance the user experience and reinforce the theme.
